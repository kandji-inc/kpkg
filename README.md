## About
A command-line tool designed for programmatic management of Kandji Custom Apps

Configurable in a variety of ways, Kandji Packages can be used to create, update, and enforce Custom Apps in Kandji

Fully open source, we welcome contributions and feedback to improve the tool!

## Prerequisites
Before running Kandji Packages, ensure you have the following:

- Kandji API token ([required permissions](#kandji-token-permissions))
- Slack webhook token (optional; [setup instructions](#slack-token-setup))

## Initial Setup

1. [Click here](https://github.com/kandji-inc/kpkg/releases/latest) to download the latest `.pkg` release
2. Right-click the downloaded `.pkg`, select `Open`, and follow the installation prompts
3. Once installed, open Terminal and run `kpkg-setup` to interactively set required parameters (written to `config.json`)
 - **Kandji API URL** (`TENANT.api.[eu.]kandji.io`)
 - **Secrets keystore selection** (ENV and/or user's login keychain)
 - **Kandji bearer token**
 - **Slack webhook token** (optional)

> [!TIP]
> Set `ENV` values for `KANDJI_API_URL` (`str`) and `ENV_KEYSTORE` (`bool`) to override their settings in `config.json`

[See below](#kpkg-setup-flags) for available `kpkg-setup` flags

## Usage

`kpkg` and `kpkg-setup` are the two Kandji Packages binaries

`kpkg` is the main executable, and must be called with one of two required flags: `-p`/`-b`
  - `-p` accepts a local path to a valid `.pkg` or `.dmg` for upload
  - `-b` accepts a Homebrew cask name; `brew` download must be a valid `.pkg` or `.dmg` for upload

### Examples

#### Uploading to Kandji from existing download:

- Download the latest Google Chrome installer [here](https://dl.google.com/dl/chrome/mac/universal/stable/gcem/GoogleChrome.pkg)
- Run `kpkg -p /path/to/downloaded/GoogleChrome.pkg`
- If the package is not found in Kandji, Kandji Packages will create a new Custom App
- If the package is found (by name), Kandji Packages will update the existing Custom App

#### Uploading to Kandji, sourcing/downloading updates from Homebrew

- Ensure Homebrew is installed on-disk with `brew` available in your `PATH`
  - If not installed, download the [latest installer package here](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/releases/latest)
- Recommend running `brew search --casks CASK` to confirm the correct cask name

```
âžœ  ~ brew search --casks googlechrome
==> Casks
google-chrome
```
- Run `kpkg -b CASK`
- Will use local download if present, otherwise fetches from Homebrew
- Same as above, if found in Kandji, will update the existing Custom App, else creates new

## Configuration Options

Kandji Packages supports both runtime flags and centralized options for customizing your PKG/DMG --> Kandji workflow

Configuration files are stored in `~/Library/KandjiPackages`

### Kandji Packages Config

- `config.json` includes defaults if no per-recipe settings are found
  - Config can be modified as desired to set preferred defaults
  - [See below](#configjson) for an overview of available options and a sample config

### Command Line Flags

- `kpkg` accepts optional args to set/override the following:
  - Always create new Custom App
  - Dry run of Kandji Packages (do not modify Kandji)
  - Custom app name
  - Custom app name (test)
  - Self Service category
  - Self Service category (test)
  - [See below](#kpkg-flags) for detailed usage instructions

> [!NOTE]
> If multiple configuration types are set during runtime, those passed via command line supersede any mappings

### Package Map

- A package map (`package_map.json`) can be defined to associate packages by ID to Kandji Custom Apps
  - Key is the package ID
    - Run `kpkg-setup -i` to identify the package ID for one or multiple `.pkg`s (also accepts `.dmg`s)
    - [See below](#kpkg-setup-flags) for full usage instructions for `kpkg-setup`
  - Below values can be defined in-map:
    - Custom app name (`prod_name`)
    - Custom app name (test) (`test_name`)
    - Self Service category (`ss_category`)
    - Self Service category (test) (`test_category`)
  - [See below](#package_mapjson) for a sample config

> [!TIP]
> Running `kpkg-setup -m` exports a .csv containing Custom App names and Self Service categories to help populate `package_map.json`

### Brew Cron

- Version `1.1.0` introduces new functionality to configure/create a background service (macOS LaunchAgent) to periodically execute `kpkg -b` against a defined list of brew casks
  - A list of available Homebrew casks can be found [here](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask)
  - Service runtime logs to `~/Library/KandjiPackages/kpkg.log`, same as ad hoc `kpkg` executions
- To get started, run `kpkg-setup -b`, which:
  - Creates/loads a config file (`brew_cron.json`) defined with a list of Homebrew casks and runtime frequency
  - Populates from config and writes an agent to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.kandji.kpkg.brewcron.plist`
    - The LaunchAgent is immediately loaded, then runs every `n` hours thereafter to check for Homebrew cask updates
      - If the brew source package matches the Kandji installer (by shasum), `kpkg` skips the upload
      - If a change is detected, `kpkg` uploads the new version to Kandji (and updates the accompanying audit script if enabled)
- If `~/Library/KandjiPackages/brew_cron.json` is missing, an interactive setup first asks how often to run (in hours), and which casks to monitor

```
04:59:44 PM : brew_cron.json config is missing or invalid
Create it now? (Y/N):y
Enter value for how frequently cron brew should run (in hours) (e.g. 1 â€“ 168):
8
04:59:47 PM : kpkg brew cron will run every 8 hours

Enter value for brew casks which should run, comma-separated (e.g. google-chrome,firefox,slack):
grandperspective,suspicious-package

04:59:55 PM : Confirmed below casks are valid:

grandperspective,suspicious-package

04:59:56 PM : Wrote service with above casks scoped to ~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.kandji.kpkg.brewcron.plist
04:59:56 PM : Successfully bootstrapped ~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.kandji.kpkg.brewcron.plist â€” service is now active
04:59:56 PM : Run the following to monitor progress (CTRL+C to quit):
tail -f ~/Library/KandjiPackages/kpkg.log
```

> [!NOTE]
> Once the service is activated via the LaunchAgent, you may see a Notification Center message display `"zsh" is an item that can run in the background.`

- If an existing config is present at `~/Library/KandjiPackages/brew_cron.json` when running `kpkg-setup -b`, the LaunchAgent is refreshed with those values and reloaded
  - [See below](#brew_cronjson) for a sample config

```
05:00:30 PM : Reading config from ~/Library/KandjiPackages/brew_cron.json
05:00:31 PM : Confirmed all casks are valid
05:00:31 PM : Wrote agent to ~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.kandji.kpkg.brewcron.plist
05:00:31 PM : Bootstrapped ~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.kandji.kpkg.brewcron.plist
05:00:31 PM : Run the following to monitor progress (CTRL+C to quit):
tail -f ~/Library/KandjiPackages/kpkg.log
```

- Interactively add additional casks to `brew_cron.json` by calling `kpkg-setup -b -a`
- You can also add/remove casks by editing `brew_cron.json` directly
  - **NOTE**: If `brew_cron.json` is directly modified, run `kpkg-setup -b` to reload the LaunchAgent with the updated config
- To uninstall the Brew Cron service (unload and remove LaunchAgent), run `kpkg-setup -b -u`
  - This does **not** remove `brew_cron.json`, so the service can be reloaded at any time by re-running `kpkg-setup -b`

## Runtime Considerations

### Supported Custom Apps
- Currently, both installer packages and disk images are supported by this project
  - Packages include flat, component, and distribution types (`.pkg`/`.mpkg`)
  - Disk image contents may include `.app` or `.pkg` (`.dmg`)
- Based on interest, new features may be considered and added over time
  - We would also welcome contributions!
- `.pkg`/`.dmg` uploads can be configured with any Kandji enforcement type (see below)
  - This includes installers whose payloads are app bundles (`.app`) or command line tools/binaries
    - Audit/enforcement criteria are determined from:
      - An app bundle's `Info.plist`
      - A binary's installer package metadata (must contain version)

### Enforcements
- Kandji Packages supports three enforcement types (configurable in `config.json`), which sets enforcement type for new Custom Apps:
  - `audit_enforce` (Default)
  - `install_once`
  - `self_service`
- When updating _existing_ Custom Apps, Kandji Packages will respect the enforcement type already set in Kandji
- If method can't be read from `config.json`, enforcement defaults to `install_once`

> [!NOTE]
> When a Self Service category is defined via command line/map, enforcement is automatically set to `self_service` (ignoring `config.json`) during new app creation

#### `audit_enforce`
- Setting `audit_enforce` bundles `audit_app_and_version.zsh` for the Custom App's Audit Script during creation
  - App name, identifier, and version details are automatically populated in the audit script prior to upload
  - Subsequent updates to apps with audit enforcement receive an updated audit script with latest app info, version, and enforcement dates
- Up to two Custom App names can be specified (via command line or map), one for production workflows (`prod_name`) and the other for testing (`test_name`)
  - Production defaults to **5 days** prior to enforcement, with testing set to **0 days** (immediate enforcement)
    - Days until enforcement values are configurable in `config.json`
  - If `audit_enforce` is set but no values provided for `prod_name` or `test_name`, Kandji Packages still uses the prod delay set in `config.json`
    - If delay values are removed from `config.json`, Kandji Packages will fall back to an enforcement delay of **3 days**
- [See below](#audit-enforcement-examples) for Kandji audit/enforcement output examples
- If enforcement is due, but the app in use by the user, the user will be prompted to close the app, else delay one hour
![Delay Available](https://github.com/kandji-inc/support/assets/27963671/c74148c5-5e8e-4673-a04e-e2ef480604f7)
- Once the delay has lapsed, the user will again be prompted to quit, but with no delay option
![Enforcement Due](https://github.com/kandji-inc/support/assets/27963671/8c4496ae-1c82-4297-a5c2-f0dc616c4f39)

> [!CAUTION]
> `audit_app_and_version.zsh` immediately installs the custom app if not found on-disk!
>
> Otherwise, waits until deadline to validate installed version matches or exceeds the enforced

#### `self_service`
- With `self_service` enforcement, it is recommended to define a category via command line/map for `ss_category` (accompanying `prod_name`)
  - If not, will fall back to defined `self_service_category` (Default: `Apps`)
- Test workflows can be used with Self Service, but also recommend defining `test_category` (accompanying `test_name`)
  - Otherwise, falls back to `test_self_service_category` (Default: `Utilities`)
    - Default Self Service categories are configurable in `config.json`

[See here](https://support.kandji.io/support/solutions/articles/72000558748-custom-apps-overview) for more information regarding Kandji Custom App enforcement

### Custom App Behavior

#### New Custom Apps
- If no value is provided for `custom_app.prod_name` in recipe/override XML, the naming convention will be taken from the `config.json` default

#### Dynamic Lookup
- Kandji Packages supports dynamic lookup, used as a fallback if a definitive Custom App cannot be found by name
  - Configurable in `config.json` under `zz_defaults.dynamic_lookup`
- Lack of definitive Custom App includes both matching duplicates (by name) as well as when no matches are found
  - For duplicates by name, if dynamic lookup is disabled, duplicates are posted to Slack with metadata (creation date, etc.)
  - For no matches by name, if dynamic lookup is disabled, Kandji Packages will create a new entry if so configured, otherwise exit
- During dynamic lookup, Kandji Packages detects all existing Custom App PKGs and identify any that are similar by name to the provided installation media (PKG/DMG)
  - Of those, the highest version(s) will be detected from the PKG/DMG name (given standard formatting NAME-VERSION.pkg)
  - If multiple highest versions are detected (compared via semantic version), the oldest Custom App by last modification is selected for update

> [!CAUTION]
> Dynamic lookup will replace a Custom App's previous package without confirmation!
>
> This may have unintended impact, so recommend first testing with dry run enabled (`-y`)

## Technical Details

### Secrets Management
- Kandji Packages supports two keystore options for storing tokens:
  - `environment` variables (`ENV`)
    - During `kpkg-setup`, secret storage in the user's dotfile is determined from the default shell; `UserShell` from `dscl`
    - For `zsh`, `.zshenv` is used; for `bash`, `.bash_profile`; otherwise, `.profile`
    - If setting `ENV` programmatically for runtime, ensure `ENV_KEYSTORE` is set to `true` to enable ENV keystore
  - macOS login keychain (for console user)
    - During `kpkg-setup`, keychain source is determined from `/usr/bin/security login-keychain`
    - Running either `kpkg-setup` or `kpkg` may prompt the user to unlock the keychain if locked before continuing

> [!CAUTION]
> Recommended use of this tool is on a Privileged Access Workstation/Hardened Device, accessible only to authorized users
>
> Storing secrets on-disk always poses some risk, so ensure proper security measures are in place


### Kandji Token Permissions

Configure your Kandji bearer token to include the following scope:

- <ins>**Library**</ins>

### kpkg-setup Flags

`kpkg-setup` will run through initial setup to populate required variables if invoked without flags.

See below for full usage guide:

```
Usage: kpkg-setup [-h/--help|-a/--addcask|-b/--brewcron|-c/--config|-i/--idfind|-m/--map|-r/--reset|-u/--uninstall]

Conducts prechecks to ensure all required dependencies are available prior to runtime.
Once confirmed, reads and prompts to populate values in config.json if any are invalid.

Options:
-h, --help                       Show this help message and exit
-a, --addcask                    Prompt to add new cask values to brew_cron.json; write updated values to LaunchAgent and reload (must be paired with -b/--brewcron)
-b, --brewcron                   Prompt to populate brew_cron.json (if missing) or read in existing config; write provided values to LaunchAgent and load
-c, --config                     Configure config.json with required values for runtime (don't store secrets)
-i, --idfind                     Populate to CSV names and ids of provided installer media (accepts .pkg/dmg or dir of .pkgs/dmgs)
-m, --map                        Populate to CSV usable values for package_map.json
-r, --reset                      Prompt to reset/overwrite configurable variables/secrets
-u, --uninstall                  Unload and remove agent from ~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.kandji.kpkg.brewcron.plist (must be paired with -b/--brewcron)
